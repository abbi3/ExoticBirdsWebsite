Create an Admin Dashboard for subscription management with the following requirements:

Admin account (seed user)

Email: huzefafw@gmail.com

Password: Huzi@123

Admin page features / UI

Login page

Admin can sign in with the seed credentials above.

Show clear error messages for invalid credentials.

Subscriptions list (main view)

Display a searchable, paginated table with these columns:

Subscriber Name

Mobile Number

Subscription Plan (Monthly / 6 Months / Annual)

Subscription Start Date

Subscription End Date

Amount Paid

Bird(s) Owned (text)

Consultations Remaining (numeric)

Status (Active / Expired / Consultations Exhausted)

Actions (View, Edit, Update Consultations)

Allow sorting by name, start date, end date, amount paid.

Include a quick filter for Plan type and Status.

View / Edit subscription modal

Clicking View opens a read-only details modal with all fields.

Clicking Edit opens a form to update name, mobile, start/end dates, birds, amount paid and plan type.

Validation for phone format and dates.

Update Consultations

Provide a one-click control in the Actions column: Update Consultations.

When admin opens it, show three buttons/options to set the consultations remaining based on plan:

Monthly → 2 consultations

6 Months → 18 consultations

Annual → 48 consultations

If admin selects an option, set (or reset) the Consultations Remaining to that number.

Allow a manual override numeric input for exceptional cases (with confirmation).

Consultation usage tracking & auto-flag

The dashboard must allow decrementing Consultations Remaining when a consultation is used (either via an admin button or an automated count if integrated later).

When Consultations Remaining reaches 0, set Status to Consultations Exhausted and visually highlight the row (e.g., red badge).

When consultations are exhausted, surface a clear label and show an action/button: Offer Top-up (top-up purchase flow / UI will be implemented later).

(User notification feature will be implemented later — for now only show the flag and top-up action in admin UI.)

Other admin actions

Ability to create a new subscription record manually.

Ability to delete (soft delete) a subscription.

Export selected subscriptions to CSV.

Basic audit log (who updated consultations and timestamp).
