What is CITES and why is it important?

CITES (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora) is an international agreement that ensures the trade of exotic animals and birds is done responsibly and ethically. It helps protect endangered species while allowing bird enthusiasts to legally own and care for captive-bred exotic birds. All the birds we deal with are compliant with CITES regulations, so you can own them with complete peace of mind.

Is it legal to own exotic birds in India?

Yes, absolutely! It is completely legal to own exotic birds in India, provided they are non-native species (not originally from India). These include beautiful and popular species like Macaws, Cockatoos, and African Greys. The Indian government allows keeping and breeding of such birds as long as they are captive-bred and not taken from the wild.
Owning an exotic bird is a wonderful experience â€” and we ensure all our birds are ethically bred, healthy, and fully compliant with Indian and international guidelines.
