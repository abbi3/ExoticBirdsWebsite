Add a full Appointment Booking Module to the existing Fancy Feathers website.
This module will allow users to book doctor consultations for exotic birds, based on the number of consultations available in their subscription plan.

The system must display available slots dynamically, prevent double bookings, and reflect all confirmed appointments in the Admin Dashboard.

User Experience and Flow

Access Point

Add an Appointment / Calendar icon on the user dashboard and navigation bar.

When clicked, open the Appointment Booking Page or Modal.

Check Subscription Allowance

On opening the booking screen, verify the user’s remaining consultation credits from their active subscription.

If no credits remain, display:

“You have no consultations left. Please purchase a top-up to continue.”

Include a button linking to the top-up page.

If credits are available, allow the user to proceed.

Calendar View

Display an interactive calendar view where users can select an appointment date.

Disable all past dates and holidays or blocked days.

Once a date is selected, show available time slots between 10:00 AM and 5:00 PM.

Time Slots

Slot duration: 30 minutes (default; admin configurable).

Display slots such as: 10:00, 10:30, 11:00, 11:30, etc. up to 16:30.

If a slot is already booked by another user, mark it as Unavailable (gray or crossed out).

Only available slots should be clickable.

Business Rules

Slot Conflict Prevention

If a time slot is already booked by another user, mark it as unavailable instantly for all users.

Ensure bookings are locked at confirmation to prevent overlap.

Cancellation & Reschedule Policy

Free cancellation or reschedule allowed up to 12 hours before appointment time.

If canceled before this window → consultation credit is restored.

If canceled within 12 hours → credit is consumed.

Admin can override and manually restore credits when necessary.

Multi-Bird Sessions

Each appointment consumes one consultation credit.

For multiple birds, user must book separate appointments (unless admin manually schedules combined session).

Automatic Increment

When a new appointment is confirmed, increment “Active Appointments” count (for analytics or admin dashboard stats).

Timezone & Format

Use 24-hour format in backend and local timezone display for users (IST).

Store times internally in UTC.
