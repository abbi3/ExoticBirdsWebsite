I want you to extend the existing website (which already has subscription plans, discount coupons, and the admin dashboard) with the following new functionality:

USER ACCOUNT CREATION AND LOGIN SYSTEM (AFTER SUBSCRIPTION)

Once a user completes a subscription, prompt the user to create an account.

User Account Creation Flow:

The User ID should be automatically set as the phone number the user entered while filling the subscription form.

This field should be non-editable and validated to ensure it matches the phone number used during subscription.

The user will be asked to create a password and confirm password.

Password requirements: Minimum 8 characters, at least one capital letter, one number, and one special character.

Add a “Show/Hide Password” toggle.

Validate both passwords match before submission.

Once the account is successfully created, show this message:
✅ “Your account has been created successfully. You can now log in using your phone number and password.”

USER LOGIN FLOW

Create a Login Page with the following fields:

User ID (Phone Number)

Password

Validate credentials.

If incorrect, show error message: ❌ “Invalid user ID or password.”

On successful login, redirect the user to their User Dashboard.

USER DASHBOARD

After login, show the user all their subscription details and bird-related data.

Dashboard sections:

1. Subscription Overview

Subscription Plan (Monthly / 6 Months / Annual)

Subscription Start Date

Subscription End Date

Amount Paid (final after discount)

Coupon Code (if used)

Discount %

Consultations Remaining

Subscription Status (Active / Expired / Consultations Exhausted)

If consultations are finished (0 remaining), display a message:
⚠️ “You have used all your consultations for this plan. Please purchase a top-up plan to continue.”

2. Bird Details Section

Allow the user to provide more information about their bird.

Fields:

Bird Name

Species (e.g., Macaw, Conure, Cockatoo, etc.)

Ring ID

Weight (in grams)

Age (in months or years)

Issues / Symptoms (multi-line text box)

Buttons:

Save Bird Details → shows message “Your bird’s details have been saved successfully.”

Edit Bird Details → allows user to update anytime.

Add Another Bird → supports multiple birds if user owns more than one.

3. Consultation Summary

Display total consultations available vs. used vs. remaining.

Show visual progress (e.g., progress bar or percentage).

Example:

Plan: 6 Months
Total Consultations: 18
Used: 3
Remaining: 15

ADMIN SYNCHRONIZATION

All user details, including bird data, should automatically appear in the Admin Dashboard under the same user profile.

When admin opens any user’s record, they should see:

User Name

Mobile Number

Subscription Plan

Start & End Dates

Amount Paid (Original + Final)

Coupon Used

Consultations Remaining

Bird Details:

Bird Name

Species

Ring ID

Weight

Age

Symptoms / Issues

✅ Admin should be able to update or correct bird details if needed.
✅ Any admin updates should automatically reflect in the user’s dashboard.
