                  My name is <strong className="text-foreground">Ali</strong>, and for the past <strong className="text-foreground">12+ years</strong>, 
                  I have been managing Fancy Feathers India â€” a heartfelt initiative born out of love, care, and deep respect for exotic birds.
                </p>

                <p>
                  I was born and raised in a family surrounded by exotic birds, and my journey with them started long before I even realized 
                  it was my calling. From a young age, I learned how to raise, groom, and train birds with empathy and understanding â€” 
                  not just as pets, but as companions with emotions, intelligence, and a voice of their own.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Over the years, I have pursued professional training in bird behavior from renowned experts outside India, and continue 
                  to expand my knowledge by reading and studying avian psychology and care. But beyond education, it's the everyday bond 
                  with these magnificent creatures that has shaped who I am today.
                </p>

                <div className="bg-primary/10 p-4 rounded-lg border-l-4 border-l-primary">
                  <p className="font-semibold text-foreground mb-2">My mission is simple yet profound â€”</p>
                  <p className="text-primary font-medium">ðŸ‘‰ To ensure every bird lives a happy, healthy, and cage-free life.</p>
                </div>

                <p>
                  At Fancy Feathers, my goal is to spread awareness, educate bird owners, and build a community that truly understands 
                  what it means to care for exotic birds responsibly. I believe that birds should not be confined to cages; they deserve 
                  space to fly, socialize, and express themselves freely.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Whether you're a bird parent seeking guidance on care, nutrition, or behavior training â€” or someone who wishes to bring 
                  home an exotic bird from a trusted, ethical, and healthy bloodline â€” I'm here to help.
